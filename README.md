# Rock Paper Scissors - Correspondence Game

A URL-based Rock Paper Scissors game built with the configurable correspondence games framework.

## Features

- ✅ **Config-driven**: Powered by YAML configuration
- ✅ **URL-based gameplay**: Share links to play asynchronously
- ✅ **Framework components**: Uses DynamicChoiceBoard and DynamicPayoffMatrix
- ✅ **3 rounds**: Quick games with running totals
- ✅ **Zero-sum scoring**: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1, ties get 0

## Quick Start

### Install & Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5174/rock-paper-scissors/`

### How to Play

1. **Player 1** starts the game and makes their choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors)
2. Copy the URL and send it to **Player 2**
3. **Player 2** opens the URL and makes their choice
4. Results are revealed and totals are updated
5. Repeat for 3 rounds
6. Winner is determined by highest total score

## Game Configuration

The game is defined in `games/configs/rock-paper-scissors.yaml`:

```yaml
metadata:
  id: rock-paper-scissors
  name: "Rock Paper Scissors"
  version: "1.0.0"

choices:
  - id: rock
    label: "Rock"
    icon: "🪨"
  - id: paper
    label: "Paper"
    icon: "📄"
  - id: scissors
    label: "Scissors"
    icon: "✂️"

# 9 payoff rules (3×3 combinations)
# Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock
```

## Framework Components Used

### DynamicChoiceBoard
Renders choice buttons dynamically based on config:
- Adapts to any number of choices
- Shows icons and descriptions
- Applies theme colors

### DynamicPayoffMatrix
Displays payoff outcomes:
- Color-coded scores (green=positive, red=negative)
- Shows all possible combinations
- Outcome text for each scenario

### Game Engines
- **PayoffEngine**: Calculates scores from config rules
- **TurnEngine**: Manages round progression

## Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # Start dev server (port 5174)
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build
npm run type-check   # TypeScript validation
```

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy the `dist/` directory to GitHub Pages

3. Ensure `vite.config.ts` has correct base path:
   ```ts
   base: '/rock-paper-scissors/'
   ```

## Customization

### Change Number of Rounds

Edit `games/configs/rock-paper-scissors.yaml`:

```yaml
progression:
  totalRounds: 5  # Change to any number
```

### Add New Choices

To create Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock:

1. Add new choices to `choices` array
2. Add all payoff rules (5×5 = 25 combinations)
3. Framework handles the rest automatically!

### Theme Colors

```yaml
ui:
  primaryColor: "#ef4444"      # Red theme
  secondaryColor: "#f59e0b"    # Orange accent
```

## Architecture

This game demonstrates the configurable framework's capabilities:

- **No hardcoded game logic** - everything from YAML
- **Dynamic UI generation** - adapts to config
- **Type-safe** - Zod validation at runtime
- **Reusable** - same components work for any game
